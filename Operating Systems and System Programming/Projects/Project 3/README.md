# Project 3: Unix Shell
The third and final project is about building a simple Unix shell that acts as an CLI 
and can be used either in interactive mode or batch mode. The shell handles some basic built-in commands, 
redirection of inputs to an output file, and finally multiple commands, that can be executed in parallel.

## How To Run The Program:

- Copy the wish.c file
- Translate the file using for example gcc: "gcc wish.c -o wish"
- Run the program using "./wish" or "./wish [file]"
