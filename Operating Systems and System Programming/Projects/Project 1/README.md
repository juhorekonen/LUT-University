# Project 1: Warmup to C and Unix programming
The first project *reverse.c* is a simple program that takes an input and output file as arguments, 
them being stdin and stdout if not specified. The program then checks whether the two files are different, 
and in that case prints the input to the output in reverse order using a linked list structure.

## How To Run The Program:

- Copy the reverse.c file
- Translate the file using for example gcc: "gcc reverse.c -o reverse"
- Run the program using "./reverse"
