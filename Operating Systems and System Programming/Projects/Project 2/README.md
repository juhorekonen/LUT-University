# Project 2: Unix Utilities
The second project about Unix utilities contains four different simple programs, 
my-cat.c that takes a file as an input and then prints its contents its contents to the terminal, 
my-grep.c that reads a file line by line trying to find user-specified search term and prints out all 
lines containing the term, and finally my-zip.c and my-unzip.c files that zip and unzip files.

## How To Run These Programs:

- Copy any of the files
- Translate the file using for example gcc: "gcc my-cat.c -o my-cat"
- Run the program using "./my-cat"
