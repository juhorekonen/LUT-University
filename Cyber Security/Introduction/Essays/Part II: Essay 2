Why is cyber security such a big deal today and whose job it actually is to protect you.
Write an essay of 200 words reflecting the importance of cyber security and whose job it is.

- We are currently living in a rapidly changing digital world. In my opinion, cyber security nowadays is extremely important mainly because it protects our private life and private data as well as financial assets and medical reports from numerous types of online attacks. 
  As stated in this course, attacks towards cyber security are ever-evolving and the attackers are constantly creating and finding new methods to do damage. 
  These range from data breaches to identity thefts usually through a malware or ransomware. Because of this, cyber security's importance will only be increasing in the future.

- So, whose responsibility is to take care of my security? I don't think there's a one single entity that should be responsible but it should rather be a sum of many factors. 
  As an individual, I have the responsibility to decide what kind of websites or applications I'm using, how I'm creating strong and versatile passwords and how I am keeping my softwares updated. 
  This could also include using a anti-malware software. 

- On the other hand I feel like companies should be able to protect the privacy of the users. 
  Another good example is society, whose job is to protect citizens by teaching about cyber security.
