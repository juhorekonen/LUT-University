What are the costs when dealing with cyber security attacks?

- The costs of a cyber security attack always vary based on the damage of the attack but the most common ones and maybe the most obvious direct costs are the financial losses which usually equals to the company losing money right away. 
  The money is used to identificate the breach and look into it, pay for the company's own employees or third party companies to repair and upgrade the impacted systems and possibly even compensate any affected parties like employees or clients (i.e. paying them in return of lost private information). 
  Part of financial losses also include the legal consequences, potential fines and other penalties, specially if the cyber attack is not disclosed by the company themselves but rather by someone else finding out.

- Reputational damage, being direct or indirect, will usually be significant resulting in a loss of customers, clients or even sponsorships. 
  The image of the company is usually what makes up a big part of their value in people's minds as well as in the stock market. 
  So in one way or another, the image taking a hit will probably lose a lot of money.

- One indirect cost that comes to mind is this so called maintenance break which will usually take part if let's say a website or an application is down. 
  For companies that are constantly making money from users or have for example some servers running 24/7 are highly affected if the servers go down. 
  So technically they are not losing money but are not making what they would otherwise.
