Why wouldn't a company disclose that it has been breached?

- The single biggest reason for not wanting to disclose a breach is probably fear of losing reputation, which is valuable to every company. 
  Addition to that, things like losing customers and trust to the company in general, legal consequences, potential fines, negative publicity 
  and effects to the company's value on stock market could be pretty heavy reasons. 

- Companies may also delay the disclosure and for that I think the main reason is that this gives time for the company 
  to identify and fix the problems as well as their security flaws by themselves before customers or general public becomes aware.
