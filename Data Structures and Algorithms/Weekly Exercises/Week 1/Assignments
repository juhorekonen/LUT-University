**Assignment 1.1: Insertion Sort (3 points)**

Following pseudo code sorts an array of integers. Command swap switches values of two variables.

function isort(A)
    for i = 1 to size(A)-1
        j = i-1
        while (j >= 0) and (A[j] > A[j+1])
            swap(A[j], A[j+1])
            j = j-1
    return

Create the following function in Python:

      isort(A: list): sorts a given list of integers. Implement the given pseudo code to this function.

Limits:

    the maximum length of the list is 10^3

    each integer is between 1...10^3




**Assignment 1.2 Prime Numbers (3 points)**

Given a number N how many prime numbers are less or equal to N? 
For example if N=7 there are four prime numbers: 2, 3, 5 and 7
(note that 1 is not a prime number).

Create the following function in Python:

    primes(N: int): returns the numbers of primes that are less or equal to N

Limits: 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5




**Assignment 1.3: Is it a Triangle? (3 points)**

Three integers a, b and c presents the side lenghts of a triangle. 
Can you build any triangle from those three sides?

For example:

  sides 3, 4 and 5 makes a right angle triangle
  sides 5, 5 and 3 makes an isosceles triangle
  sides 7, 3 and 3 doesn't make a triangle
  sides 4, 3 and −1 doesn't make a triangle

Create the following function in Python:

    triangle(a: int, b: int, c: int): returns a boolean True if triangle can be built, False if not
